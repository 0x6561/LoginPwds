This Program is what is know a s a 'Password Manager', it stores login information such as username, passwords, as well as notes regarding a service/account/website. The information is organized into 'Keys', which can then have one or more 'Accounts'. A key has two required fields; a Name for a Key such as bank account, a URL/Web Address for the Key. Each Account has an Account name such as 'my account', and a Login ID which is what is used to login to the site, and a password, and finally a 'Notes' section which can be used to store other information about the Account which should also be kept secret. The reason for organizing things this way is to group together mutliple accounts at a service. say you have two Gmail accounts, one professional and one personal, both accounts would be grouped under the GMail key.
The information is stored in a human readable format, xml in plaintext though the values for sensitive elements is never written to disk in plaintext. You can however print a hardcopy for storing the information offline once you have logged in. 
While in 'Edit' mode which is to say when creating or editing an Account, a 'Password Help' button is available which provides for the construction of passwords which adhere to specific criteria and are more difficult to crack. The feature will generate password 'chunks' consisting or only letters (only uppercase or lowercase), only numbers, only punctuation, or all possible characters. these chunks can be addes in the necessary order to suit your needs.
When saving an Account, your username and password will be evaluated to see if it adheres to recomended practices; such as not be used for other services, being of adequate length and complexity and not being a commonly used password.
The Program has a safety feature which will save and quit the program after SIX (6)  minutes of innactivity to safegaurd the information in case the user leaves the program open and walks away.
